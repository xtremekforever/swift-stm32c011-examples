# Usart MMIO Demo

This demo reads from USART1 on the STM32C0116-DK and echoes back everything it receives. This demo requires additional hardware:

- A UART 232 adapter, such as the [HiLetgo CP2102](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LZVEQEY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- Grove connector cable, such as this one from [Seeed Studio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074MDM36N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
